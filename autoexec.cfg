    // If you would like the same configuration to be used across multiple
    // accounts on one system, put the autoexec.cfg file into the following
    // folder:
    //
    // <DRIVE_LETTER>:\<PATH_TO_STEAM>\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
    //
    // If you would prefer separate configurations for different accounts on

    // You will see a message in the developer console if the autoexec is
    // successfully loaded upon launch.
    // You can open the developer console with the key selected in the value
    // under the "toggleconsole" entry in the CONTROLS > KEYBOARD section
    // (Default = "~" otherwise known as Tilde, or "`" otherwise known as Grave
    // on Linux and MacOS).
    //
    // If the config file does not load automatically, you can type the
    // following into the console (without the "quotation marks"):
    //     "+exec autoexec"
    // and press enter. You will then be notified of whether the game has
    // successfully loaded the autoexec.cfg file, as it will display the
    // contents of the "EXECUTION" section at the end of this file.
    //
    // You can also force the autoexec.cfg file to load automatically on every
    // launch by adding it to your launch options, through; opening Steam,
    // going to your game library, right-clicking the entry for Counter-Strike:
    // Global Offensive, selecting "Properties" then under the heading

        // In online FPS games, servers have to simulate the game world constantly.
        // This means calculating positions of objects, players, weapons, grenades,
        // also things like ballistics, blood/damage decals, particle
        // effects/physics. Not only that, but servers must keep track of where
        // these things were, are and will be simultaneously (this is expanded on
        // greatly in the TICKRATE and INTERPOLATION ADVANCED NOTE entries).
        //
        // The servers do this job by calculating everything a certain amount of
        // times per second, the more the better for the most part. A value such as
        // once per second would be a horrendous experience. So, the servers
        // simulate and update the game world in discrete time steps called
        // "ticks". A "tickrate" is a measurement of how many ticks there are per
        // second. So, assuming a base value of 1 second, a tickrate of 128 means
        // the server simulates the world 128 times per second (1 second is 1000
        // milliseconds, divide this by the tickrate value, 128, and we have a
        // result that tells us the game simulates the world every 7.8125
        // milliseconds. Whereas, a tickrate of 64, 1000 ÷ 64, means the game
        // simulates the world every 15.625 milliseconds). 64 has always been the
        // default tickrate on Valve servers, though dedicated servers use 128.
        // Newer games vary wildly, with Valorant using 128, COD Warzone and PUBG
        //reportedly using around 60 and Apex Legends (actually another Source
        // engine game) using 20. Yes, 20.
        //
        // For the most part, a higher tickrate provides a less "laggy", more
        // responsive and truer representation of the game world overall. That
        // said, tickrate is often intentionally limited to reduce instability
        // introduced by a fluctuating tickrate, as well as to reduce CPU and data
        // transmission costs for performance reasons. A lower tickrate, however,
        // increases latency in the synchronization of the game simulation between
        // the server and client, among other things creating what is now
        // infamously called: desync, with such gems as rubber-banding.
        //
        // So in summary, tickrate is a measurement for how many times per second
        // the server simulates and updates the game world, informing the client.
        // 128 is considered by most the gold standard, or even bare minimum,
        // especially in competitive play. Though Valve themselves, and many other
        // developers, have yet to capitulate to the demand and so a value of
        // around 60 is more common.
        //
        // TICKRATE ADVANCED NOTE:
        //     The servers internal update rate cannot be exceeded regardless of
        //     this settings value. As such, Valve default servers operate at a
        //     default tickrate of 64 and so values of 128 will only cause the
        //     client to demand more updates than it will actually be possible to
        //     receive. However, dedicated servers can and will correctly use a
        //     value of 128. Thus, 64 will be the stock setting here to keep
        //     compliance and circumvent any potential negative implications. But,
        //     this value must be changed via the console ingame if connecting to
        //     non-Valve dedicated servers operating at a tickrate of 128. This can
        //     be done by issuing the following commands:
        //          cl_updaterate "128"
        //          cl_cmdrate "128"
        //     to the console and pressing enter after each line. This will change
        //     the value temporarily until the next launch or executing the
        //     autoexec.cfg file again.
        //
        // INTERPOLATION ADVANCED NOTE:
        //     Interpolation, in this case, is several mechanisms used by the
        //     Source engine to make sure the game retains its fluidity. It is
        //     measured in seconds (A value of 1 = 1 second or 1000 milliseconds, a
        //     value of 0.1 = 100 milliseconds, and so on and so forth). The final
        //     value of interpolation itself is determined by dividing the current
        //     value of the "cl_interp_ratio" convar by the current value of the
        //     "cl_updaterate" convar (cl_interp_ratio ÷ cl_updaterate = interpolation).
        //
        //     If the entities in the game world were only rendered at the
        //     positions received by the server (see: TICKRATE ADVANCED NOTE),
        //     moving objects and animations would appear choppy. Dropped packets
        //     would also cause noticeable jitter. The trick to solve this problem
        //     is to go back in time for the rendering, meaning what you see on
        //     screen is not necessarily what IS happening but what WAS. This
        //     allows for the client itself to ensure players have an overall much
        //     smoother experience.
        //
        //     So, for example, a "cl_interp_ratio" value equal to 0.1 means your
        //     game client will display the data received 100 milliseconds before
        //     the last/latest data received. Coupled with an "cl_updaterate" equal
        //     to 20, the game client would receive an update every 50 milliseconds
        //     (remember interpolation is 1 = 1 second or 1000 milliseconds, so
        //     interpolation ÷ update rate or 1000 ÷ 20 = 50 milliseconds). So with
        //     interpolation equal to 0.1, the client will go back in time 100
        //     milliseconds or 2 updates (50 milliseconds + 50 milliseconds = 100
        //     milliseconds).
        //
        // INTERPOLATION RATIO ADVANCED NOTE:
        //     Ideally, this value should be set to 1 so long as you have a good
        //     enough connection, whereas if you expect issues such as highping or
        //     packet loss a value of 2 is the correct choice. But, when playing
        //     competitively against opponents that have this value set to 2 versus
        //     your value of 1, you could technically be at a disadvantage, albeit
        //     very slight. As such, the only sensible choice and conclusion is
        //     therefore a value of 2. This way the game retains its fluidity,
        //     protection against packet loss and isn't at a disadvantage compared
        //     to other players. What this means technically, is that you will
        //     retain 2000 milliseconds worth of updates:
        //
        //     For 64 tick servers, for example:
        //         cl_interp_ratio ÷ cl_updaterate or 2000 ÷ 64 = 31.250, so 2000ms
        //         worth of updates at every 31.250ms or 2000 ÷ 31.250 = 64 updates
        //         per second.
        //
        //     For 128 tick servers, for example:
        //         cl_interp_ratio ÷ cl_updaterate or 2000 ÷ 128 = 15.625, so
        //         2000msworth of updates at every 15.625ms = 128 updates per
        //         second.
        //
        //     Now. you might be thinking, and would technically be correct, that a
        //     value of 1 would keep only the most recent representation of the
        //     simulation, meaning more accurate to the current positions etc and
        //     less "overhead". But, thanks to "cl_lagcompensation" this is not as
        //     simple as it seems.
        //
        // LAG COMPENSATION ADVANCED NOTE:
        //     Between the representation of the game world that is currently
        //     displayed on your monitor and the simulation of the game world
        //     currently on the server, there is a HUGE difference. But, don't
        //     panic, the server knows the interpolation and ping of each player
        //     independently. So, the server can take care of the differences in
        //     configuration of each player using this convar.
        //
        //     There are times when you shoot that you feel your crosshair was not
        //     precisely aiming at another player or where you feel it was but when
        //     you shoot he doesn't get hurt or die. The server calculates events
        //     as such:
        //          current server time - packet latency value - client interpolation value = command execution time
        //     The command execution time means there is a difference between the
        //     reception time of updates that you send to the server (the real time
        //     of the real world) such as mouse input and the time which it
        //     actually occurs ingame (simulated time). To compute this simulated
        //     time from the real time, the server takes note of your ping (the
        //     round-trip time of the data from client to server) and of your
        //     interpolation time, without cl_lagcompensation the disparity between
        //     input - output would be even bigger.
        //
        // PREDICT ADVANCED NOTE
        //     This is another mechanism which the engine uses to smooth out the
        //     simulation and provide a more fluid experience. With a "cl_predict"
        //     value of 1 (meaning input prediction activated), the client will
        //     extrapolate the players intervening positions AFTER sending an
        //     update to the server of the players input and before receiving a
        //     response, technically moving before the server is aware and then
        //     correcting it with the next update returned from the server. Which
        //     will either continue until the completion of the match or cause
        //     rubber-banding.
        //
        //     Let's assume a player has a network latency of 150 milliseconds and
        //     starts to move forward. The information that the forward key is
        //     pressed is stored in a user command packet and sent to the server.
        //     There, the user command is processed and the player's character
        //     model is moved forward in the game world. This world state change is
        //     then transmitted to all clients with the next snapshot update. So
        //     the player would see his actual movement with a 150 milliseconds
        //     delay after he started walking. This delay applies to all player
        //     actions like movement and ballistics etc, and is worsened with
        //     higher latencies/packet loss which can result in lag/jitter.
        //
        //     A delay between the actual player input and the corresponding visual
        //     feedback can create a disjointed and unnatural disconnect that makes
        //     it hard to move or aim precisely. Client-side input prediction is a
        //     way to remove this delay and let the player's actions feel more
        //     instant. Instead of waiting for the server to update the position,
        //     the local client just predicts the results of its own user commands
        //     which it still sends to the server for processing. As the client
        //     runs exactly the same code and rules the server will use to process
        //     the user commands, the result should be identical. After the
        //     prediction is finished, the local player will move instantly to the
        //     new location while the server still sees him at the old place.

            // FPS ADVANCED NOTE:
            //     In basic terms, higher FPS does often equal an advantage for
            //     many reasons, among them are more fluid animations with less
            //     blurring/ghosting, as well as known quirk of some games and
            //     their engines which can see increased fire rates, or more
            //     bullets per second, from higher FPS values especially if they
            //     sync with the fire rate of ingame weapons, see:
